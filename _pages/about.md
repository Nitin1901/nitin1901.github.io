I am a 4<sup>th</sup> year Integrated Masters student at the [University of Hyderabad](https://uohyd.ac.in) majoring in `Computer Science`.

My research interests include:
* Machine Learning
* Deep Learning
* Computer Vision
* Reinforcement Learning (*I am new to this*)

I started my research career in 2020 by collaborating with Professors and PhD scholars.
I intend to work `ETHICALLY` and with `INTEGRITY`.
