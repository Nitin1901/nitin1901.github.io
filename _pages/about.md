I am a dedicated and passionate tech enthusiast with a strong focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its transformative potential. Currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in `Artificial Intelligence` at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), I also hold a Masters's degree in `Computer Science` from the prestigious [University of Hyderabad](https://uohyd.ac.in/) where my thesis focuses on `Software Defect Prediction`.

Throughout my academic and research endeavors, I have had the privilege to collaborate with distinguished professors and PhD scholars. I have co-authored research papers and gained valuable experience through internships at renowned institutions such as the [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie) and the [University of Calgary](https://www.ucalgary.ca/), broadening my knowledge and honing my skills in various domains.

Academic excellence has always been a top priority for me, and I take great pride in being recognized as the university topper. With a perfect 10/10 GPA in two semesters, I strive for nothing less than the highest standards of achievement and continuously push myself to excel in my studies.

If you believe that my skills and passion align with your personal/organization's goals, or if you simply wish to connect and discuss ideas, I warmly invite you to reach out. I am excited about the prospect of collaboration and the opportunity to contribute to your endeavors.

My research interests span a wide range of domains including:
* Machine Learning
* Deep Learning
* Computer Vision
* Natural Language Processing
* Explainable AI
* Medical Image Analysis

I possess a strong foundation in these areas and consistently strive to stay abreast of the latest advancements and emerging trends.
