Hello everyone, 

I officially started my internship at the University of Calgary. I cannot express how excited I am for this new phase of my career.

### A few details about my project:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Project title</strong>: Robust AI</li>
    <li><strong>Mentor</strong>: [Prof. Hadi Hemmati](https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/hadi-hemmati)</li>
    <li><strong>Project description.</strong>: Use XAI techniques in Software Engineering tools. The outcome of this project is a survey paper. Later, I will work on transformers (BERT) for some seq2seq models</li>
</ul>

The project seems interesting, right? Not only the project but Canada, its people, the lifestyle, the food and the weather is interesting as well. I hope to learn a lot in these 3 months. 

Thank you all for your wishes!
