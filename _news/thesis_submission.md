Hey all, I submitted my thesis on `Software Defect Prediction` as a part of my Integrated Master of Technology degree. 

Whoof! I can't believe 1 year research is condensed in just a 100 pages book. I will write a blog on my thesis in case you are interested to give it a read ğŸ˜‰

*P.S. Write me a mail in case I forget ğŸ˜…*
